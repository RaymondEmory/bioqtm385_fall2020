This matrix descibes all of the pairwise linear correlations between the $d$ different variables that are simultaneously measured.  While this matrix has many limitations in terms of its ability to characterize the high-dimensional data (see question below), there is often much to be learned - and it's easy to calculate! - so it's usually a great place to orient one's self when staring at a new dataset.\n","\n","To be more precise, the covariance matrix is the collection of all linear covariances between each pair of variables.  Mathematically, if $X\\in\\Re^{N\\times d}$ ($N$ is the number of data points, $d$ is the dimensionality of the data), then we define the covariance matrix, C, via:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","C_{ij} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=1}^N (X_{ki} - \\bar{X_i})(X_{kj} - \\bar{X_j}),\n","\\end{equation}\n","where \n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\bar{X_i} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=1}^N X_{ki}\n","\\end{equation}\n","is the mean of the $i$th variable in $X$.  \n","\n","Note how if $i=j$, $C_{ii}$ is simply the variance of $X_i$.  Thus, the diagonal terms of the matrix describe how individual variables vary, and each of the off-diagonal terms is the *covariance* between the two associated variables (hence the name of the overall matrix).\n","\n","While each of the entries in the matrix can be positive (positively correlated), negative (negatively correlatied), or zero (uncorrelated), the covariance matrix is symmetric (switching $i$ and $j$ in the definition of $C_{ij}$ above results in the same result, so $C_{ij} = C_{ji}$).  Symmetric matrices have many convenient [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix), including the fact that all of its eigenvalues must be greater than zero.
